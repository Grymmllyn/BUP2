notes (for public use)⬇️

this game checks a lot of w/ variables. some variables may not say [what they do] so do ctrl + f and search what the variables do (most variables are labeled)

most things [complicated] have a comment connected to it to say what it does.

if you know how to block code, I think you can figure out what's happening

*IF YOU LOOK AT THIS CODE AND SEE ERRORS MAKE SURE TO TELL ME IN THE COMMENTS!!!* (also, if it ain't THAT broke then I won't fix it cuz it probably works | don't tell me false errors also)
